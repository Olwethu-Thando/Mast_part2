The app you are building is a **culinary-themed React Native application** designed to help users explore and manage dishes across different courses, such as **starters, main courses, and desserts**. Here's a breakdown of what the app does:

### Main Features:

1. **Course and Dish Display:**
   - The app showcases various **courses** (e.g., starters, main course, dessert).
   - Each course contains a list of **dishes**, including a **name** and **description** for each dish. For instance, a "Starters" course might include dishes like **Bruschetta** or **Caesar Salad**.

2. **Detailed Course View:**
   - When the user selects a course (like "Starters" or "Main Course"), the app navigates to a **Course Detail Screen**.
   - On this screen, users can see a detailed list of all the dishes under that course, including descriptions.
   - Example: Selecting "Starters" will show dishes like "Bruschetta" with a description such as "Grilled bread topped with diced tomatoes, garlic, and basil."

3. **Add New Dish Feature:**
   - The app allows users to **add new dishes** to a course.
   - There is an **"Add New Dish" button** on the Course Detail Screen, which takes users to a separate **Add Dish Screen**.
   - On the Add Dish Screen, users can input a **new dish name** and **description**. After submitting, the dish is added to the respective course.
   
4. **Logo Display:**
   - A **logo** is displayed at the top of the Course Detail Screen, enhancing the appâ€™s branding and giving it a polished look.

### Typical User Flow:
1. **View Course List:** Users start by selecting a course they are interested in (e.g., starters, main course, desserts).
2. **Explore Dishes:** Once they select a course, they can see all the dishes listed for that course.
3. **Add New Dish:** If they want to contribute a new dish to the list, they click on the "Add New Dish" button, enter the dish details, and the dish will be added to the course.
4. **Continue Browsing:** Users can return to view other courses or explore newly added dishes.

### Possible Extensions:
- **Persistent Data:** Right now, adding a dish may not persist between sessions. You could connect the app to a backend service or local storage to save added dishes permanently.
- **Customization:** Users might be able to edit or remove dishes in the future.
- **User Interaction:** Ratings or comments on dishes could be added for more interaction.

This app serves as a platform for users to **discover, explore, and contribute to culinary options**, making it a helpful tool for planning meals or learning about different dishes.
